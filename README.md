> System for controlling your own books in Vue.js
## Description

I've been reading a lot of books for a few years now. While I was studying Vue.js, I came up with the idea of creating a small Web App to manage my books, if I have read it, and if it is being loaned to someone else.

**Main objective was to study Vue.js.**

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
